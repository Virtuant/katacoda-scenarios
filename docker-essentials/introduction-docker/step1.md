1\. First, let’s look at Docker’s help menu in our shell

`docker -h`{{execute}}

2\. Next, let’s check it see if we currently have any running containers

`docker ps`{{execute}}

3\. Finally, let’s see if we have any images in our local repository 

`docker images`{{execute}}

4\. [OPTIONAL] Go through and try other Docker commands from the help list. If you will type ```docker <command>``` you will get to see the structure syntax.
