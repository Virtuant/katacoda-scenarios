#### Conclusion 
We've covered a lot, and we have opened several cans of worms in the process. In a nutshell this has been only a small introduction into the use cases and benefits involved in using Dockerfiles. At least now we know how to create a Dockerfile, build it, explore the history, add commands, entry points, and how to copy entire apps in. This is not increditible easy stuff. Now, do a reset and let's move on. Congrats!

Great job!
