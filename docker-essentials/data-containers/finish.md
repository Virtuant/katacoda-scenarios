#### Conclusion

In this lesson we ran multiple run options, the execute command, and learned to remove both containers and images. We used (```-it```) to spin up an interactive container and (```-d```) to launch a daemon container. Then, we created a file, while inside our container, stopped it, and then started it back up to find our file still intact. Once we finished, we appropriately removed all our previous containers and images. Now, we are ready to move on to a new project, but before we do, and this will be important in every lab, do a general reset. Stop each container started during this lab. Ask your instructor if you need help doing this. Be proud of yourself!
