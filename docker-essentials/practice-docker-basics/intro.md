## Practice Docker Basics 

**Objective:** In this lesson we will attempt to fill in some of the holes from the last lesson, highlight some other helpful commands when dealing with containers, and look at what to do when we are done using our container, or image.<br>

**Preparation:** Prepare by opening up two terminal windows. One to serve as the primary and the other as a secondary. Also, navigate to the appropriate lab folder, where the lab data/material is.<br>

**Outcome:** This lesson will give the participant a more thorough overview of Docker. By the end, we’ll have started two separate containers, created a file in one, start and stop our container, and then remove it all when we’re done.<br>

**Data Files:** ```hello.py, Dockerfile```

Learning a new technology can be very overwhelming. Docker does a great job though of indexing with their help menus. In this lab we will learn more about the lifecycle of containers, how to stop and start them, execute commands instide them, how to remove them, and how to build an image from a Dockerfile.
